This project aims to provide a comprehensive cross-platform toolkit to sign, publish, and verify **[Nanopublications](https://nanopub.net)**.

Whether you're a developer looking to integrate nanopub functionalities into your application or a researcher seeking an efficient way to handle nanopublications, `nanopub-rs` offers a suite of tools tailored to meet  your needs.

## 🪄 Nanopub management

- ✍️ **Sign & Publish** nanopubs using a RSA private key. Customize your workflow with a `profile.yml` file.
- 🔍 **Verify**: ensure the integrity of nanopubs by checking their validity, whether they are signed or unsigned.
- 📥 **Fetch** nanopubs from the network using their URI.

## 📦️ Packaged for multiple interfaces

This library is packaged for easy use across various interfaces and languages:

- [🦀 **Rust developers**](rust.md): available as a Rust crate `nanopub`.
- [🐍 **Python programmers**](python.md): available as a Python pip package `nanopub-sign`.
- [🌐 **Web developers**](javascript.md): available as a NPM package `@nanopub/sign`, compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), for browser integrations with JavaScript, or NodeJS.
- [⌨️  **Terminal enthusiasts**](cli.md): binary with a Command Line Interface (CLI) for straightforward terminal operations.

## ⚔️ Cross-platform support

It runs seamlessly on:

- 🦊 Web browsers
- 🐧 Linux
- 🍎 MacOS
- 🪟 Windows

## 🧩 RDF serialization support

The library handles most RDF serializations supporting quads, including TriG, Nquads, and JSON-LD.

## 📝 Automated metadata creation

When you sign a nanopub, if it has not already been defined in the pubinfo graph yet:

- 🕓 **Automatic timestamp**: the `dct:created` attribute is used to add the date and time of creation.
- 🪪 **Creator identification**: if an ORCID is provided in the profile, it's added using `dct:creator`. The library also checks for ORCID set with `prov:wasAttributedTo` or `pav:createdBy`.
